8 Queens Problem using Uniform Cost Search(UCS)

UCS is just a variant of Dijikstra's Algorithm.
Instead of inserting all vertices into a priority queue, we insert only source.
UCS is useful for infinite graphs and those graph which are too large to represent in the memory, mainly used in Artificial Intelligence.
